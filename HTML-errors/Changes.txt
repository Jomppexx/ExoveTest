As helpful tools I used Narrator screenreader and the tab key.

Changes:
Deleted h3 style. There were 2 stylings for h3.

Added alt text for the first img, improving accessibility.

Fixed typo "...promises to work flexibility and support..." --> flexibly

Change for="tetx" to description to match labelledby of input.
	<label for="description">Name</label>
	<input name="text" type="text" aria-labelledby="description"></input>

"Insert your first name and last name" moved above input field. More logical reading order for users.

Added for="javascript" to JavaScript radio button label. Screenreader now reads name of the button and it can be selected by clicking the text.

Deleted the following lines:
  <fieldset class="column column-first">
  <fieldset class="column column-second">
They seem to do absolutely nothing and are nested fieldsets. Fieldsets are for containing input options.

Visually hidden column first and column second legends removed. visually-hidden class no longer used, so removed.

Web accessibility checkbox input fixed. Changes: id="web", value="web".

Added for="colors" to <label>Choose a color:</label>

Changed alt text of second image to something that better describes it.

Tabindex of footer link changed to 0. This way going through the page with tab finds the link before the browser tools.

Changed aria-label of FLEXOVE and TECH-XOVE link. More screen-reader friendly.
